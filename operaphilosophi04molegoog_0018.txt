TO MR. rioms.

Long did the mighty stagirire retain

The universal intellectuel reign,

Saw his own countries short-liv'd leopard elsim
The stronger Romen engle did ouffly,

Ostener renew'd his nge, end saw that dy.

Meehn it sell', in spight ol Mnhnmet, possent,
And ehas’d by e wild deluge from the east,
His monarchy new planted in the west.
But ns in time esch great imperial rece
Degeneretes, end gives some new one place:
So did this noble empire wast,
Sunlr by degreoe from glories pest,
And in the schoolmens hands it perisht quite at last.
Then nought but words it grew,
And those all berb'rous too.
lt perishh end it venisht there:
The lise end soul breeth'd out became but empty air.

The flelds, which answer’d well the encients plow,
Spent end outworn, return no harvest now,
In barren ege wild end nnglorious lie,
And bonet ol pest lertility,
The poor relief ol present poverty.
Fnod end fruit we now must went,
Unless new lands we plant.
We break up tombs with saerilegious hands;
Old rubbish we remove;
To welk in ruines, like vein ghosts‚ we love.
And with lond divining wends
We search among the dead
For treasures suriel,
Whilst still the liberal earth does hold

So mnny virgin-mines ol undiseover’d gold.
