v1.

Nor can the snow which now cold nge doen rhed
Upon thy reverend head,
Quench or nllay the noble hren within ;
But all which thou host bin,
And all thnt youth cnn he, thou'rt yet 3
So fully still dost thou
Enjoy the mnnhood ond the bloom of wit,
And nll the natural heot, hut not the sever too.
So contraries on AEtna’s top conspire;
Here honr-y fronte, ond by them breaks out fine
A secure penne the faithful neighbours keep3
Th’ emboldened snow next to the flnme doce oleep.
And if we weigh, like thee,
Nature, nnd causa, we shall see
Thnt thus it needs must be;
To things immortal time con do no wrong;
And that, which never is to die, sor ever must be young.

Funus exornet hnrbntos pompe magistron,
Et schoht¹ discipulos cogat inepta leven:
Affuhit novo lux tenebroso Hobhesius orbi.

Quanta eet laus hominem restituisse cibi?
